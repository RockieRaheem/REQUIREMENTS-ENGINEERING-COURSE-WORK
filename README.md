# Smart-Waste-Management

Urban areas in Uganda face inefficient waste management due to irregular garbage collection, lack of real-time tracking, and unreported illegal dumping. This results in environmental hazards, increased pollution, and health risks. Our solution is a Smart Waste Management System that allows users to request garbage collection, track waste trucks in real-time, and report illegal dumping incidents. By leveraging technology, we aim to streamline waste collection and improve city cleanliness.
